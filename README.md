# My First Coding Project

## Introduction to Programming

Good day! I am Jessie Mae N. Domingo from 2ECE-D and welcome to my first coding project!
This experiment is a culmination of my learning in Advanced Programming and Algorithms. As I dive into the world of programming, this projeft serves as the initial exploration of fundamental coding concepts.

Project Goals:
First, to build a slowly but surely foundation in Python programming.
Second, to demonstrate practical applications of the concepts of basic coding taught in class.
Lastly, to challenge myself with real-world coding scenarios.


### Experiment 1
#### Introduction to Programming

I. Intended Learning Outcome
  1. To identify the basic cods and functions in Python Programming.
  2. To be able to apply the different codes and functions in creating a Python program
     
II. Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit you Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

### ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM: Emoticon Converter
  Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad, and mad with their corresponding    emoticon.

    Here's a glimpse at what the function does:
      a. It finds the word "smile" and replaces it with ":)"
      b. The word "grin" transforms into ":D"
      c. "Mad" turns into ">:("
      d. Lastly, "sad" changes to ":("

    With these simple swaps, the sentence is given a more visual and fun twist, reflecting how w often communicate in modern texting like messenger, instagram          direct messages, and so much more online chatting.

### UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM: First, Middle, and Last
  Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then     print all three variables.

    Here's how it works:
    a. The first element is easy -- it's the beginning of the list.
    b. The last element, naturally, is the final item.
    c. The real magic happens in the middle. By capturing everything between the first and lasat element, the middle becomes the heart of the list, containing all         the values in between.


# Then, DONE! 

While this is an early step in my coding journey, I'm excited about the possibilities and eager to improve as I continue to learn. 
Thank you for taking the time to review my work and for giving me a chance to resubmit even after passing a wrong file at the day of the submission.
