# My First Coding Project

## Introduction to Programming

Good day! I am Jessie Mae N. Domingo from 2ECE-D and welcome to my first coding project!
This experiment is a culmination of my learning in Advanced Programming and Algorithms. As I dive into the world of programming, this projeft serves as the initial exploration of fundamental coding concepts.
